# Obstacle-Avoiding-robot-Arduino-V1

## Material used:

1. Arduino UNO.
2. Ultrasonic Sensor module (HCSR04).
3. Servo motor .
4. robot with two wheels.
5. L293D H bridge .

Check the circuit in the repository if you want to do the same circuit remember to pull of the usb cable of the arduino befor powering up with the battery(just in case).

I wanted to do a simple and a basic model of an obstacle avoiding robot with the fasts and low weight code to detect and avoid an obstacle using only One Ultrasonic Sensor one servo motor and 2 dc motors. The project is still into development to find a better and faster algorithm .
